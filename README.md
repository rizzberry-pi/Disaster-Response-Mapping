# Road Detection

First we detect roads using image processing, and classify them into different types based on their nature:

- Dirt
- Asphalt
- Gravel / Mud

Based on their location, we can also find out the slope nature of the road, whether it is steep or gentle.

This data is then colour-coded, and overlaid onto the original image, with a legend to indicate the classifications.
